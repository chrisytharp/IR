Browser forensics
    Common browser forensics artefacts are as follows:
          Browser history
          Bookmarks
          Autocomplete data
          Form history
          Cached files/images
          Cached pages
          File downloads
          Searches
          Cookies
          
C:\Users\%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default
C:\Users\%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\ChromeDefaultData


data is stored as SQLite database files, which means that we can view them easily using certain tools. Several tools allow you to view and analyse these files 
    – the most basic is the DB browser for SQLite
Another tool included within this lab is Foxtons Forensics' free 'Browser History Viewer' tool. You can load the capture files and examine them by 
  selecting ‘File’, ‘Load History’, and then ‘Load history captured using the Browser History Capturer’, selecting the relevant files.
