A handle is a connection from a process to an object or resource in a Windows operating system. Operating systems use handles for referencing internal objects like files, registry keys, resources, etc.

Memory Sections will let you investigate unsigned memory sections used by some processes. Many processes usually use legitimate dynamic link libraries (DLLs), which will be signed. This is particularly interesting because if you see any unsigned DLLs then it will be worth taking a closer look. 

Pay attention to the system processes as well. The threat actors like to avoid detection by hiding under the system processes. For example, explorer.exe or notepad.exe shouldn't be on the list of processes with outbound connections.
